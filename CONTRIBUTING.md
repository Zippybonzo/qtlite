There are a few processes to ensure we don't push terrible code to the master branch.
 1. Clone the repository
 2. Make your changes
 3. Commit to a branch labelled {username}-dev
 4. Open a pull request
 5. Wait for checks to complete and the PR to merge
 6. Delete your branch or add extra changes and reopen a PR
 7. Rinse and repeat
